# Chapter 3

## Hard Links

Hard Links can only link files on the same FS. They cannot link directories that can be done via a hard link or symbolic link otherwise know as a symlink.
An example of a symlink would be `ln -s dir / dir` from there you can verify if they have the same inode by running a simple `ls -ldi dir / dir/`

**Symlinks** will be colorized in the shell to show they are symlinks. If you delete the folder that the link is linked to that will result in a broken symlink. The correct process would be to unlink said folder and then delete the folder so no broken links exist.

## Matching File names with Shell Expansions

To make your job easier you can use shell expansions to get more work done out of a single command example being creating dirs and its subfolders.
for example running a command like `mkdir -pv /vhosts/www.{ansible,openshift,redhat}.com/{html,cgi-bin}/`

`mkdir -p` Creates the dir's but using the pathhs the `-v` flag shows the output. From there you can then specify what folders are being created and also put in a `/` to break down into another so dir so the second cert of curly braces can specify another set of folders. To verify if it was done correctly we can do a `tree -F /vHosts` for this example to see if the folders were created correctly.

## Using Shell Expansions
This can also be done if you want to create files e.g `touch {index,info,insights}.file`
we can then run a `ls -l` to verify the files were created correctly with the right file extension.

If you do happen to mess up a file extension we can do a `rename .file .log *` and that will rename the files in that dir. This is just an example.

## Creating Files using a sequential range

You can also make folders or files using a range in the case of RHEL having multiple versions.

E.g being `mkdir -pv RHEL{6..9}`
How the command works is mkdir makes the dir's `-p` does it as a path in the current dir unless specified then the `{6..9}` is the range in which the folders are made.

> Some other examples could be using to finding files  or moving around

e.g being
`ls f*` -- would grab anything that start with f.
`ls f????` -- does the same thing but anything with f and 4 characters after that f.

# Chapter 4

## Man Pages
Section 1 -- is user commands
Section 5 -- config files
Section 8 is admin commands and daemons

E.g. of using the command would be `man -k crontab` , like all commands args needs to be specified.
commands can be part of multiple sections

`export LESS='-X'`
 IF you want to access the section of a manpage file an easy way to do that would be E.g `man 5 crontab` that `man` being the command and then `5` is the section and then, in this case, `crontab` being the command you want the info on lets you look at section 5 of that particular command.

> **Fun Note**
> When running a whereis on a command E.g `whereis man` you can get info on where the ?> file is located but also where the man pages are located.

`man -k` does a search. E.g if you run `man -k boot` it will show you all the commands that commands that can be passed through at boot time.

# Chapter 5

## Redirect Output to a File or Program

```
0 --> stdin --> Keyboard
1 --> stdout --> Monitor
2 --> stderr --> Monitor
```

`<` -- is the redirector for standard output.
`>` -- Send the output of a command to a file
`>>` -- Send the error messages elsewhere E.g another file or a log.

`|` -- output of command 1 is inserted into command 2 E.g `dnf search | grep -E mysql`

When using the `>` it will overwrite any existing content. <strong> be safe when using this</strong>

`\n` -- <strong> Starts a new line! </strong>

`top -b -n 1` -- Starts top in batch mode with just a single itteration!

`hostnamectl | tee my_system` -- This is an example of printing the output of a command and throwing it into it another file. <strong> `tee` will overwrite any content in the file. a `-a` can be added to append the already used file.</strong>

`2>/dev/null` -- this throws error messages into `/dev/null` which ignores the messages on the put. E.g of the command being used `find / -size +100M 2>/dev/null`

using `EOF` an easy way to script example adding a repo file to the repost list can be done using `EOF` small example would be `cat > my file <<EOF then ending with <EOF` this will copy the data in between the EOF and throw it into that file.

## Edit Text Files from the Shell Prompt - Vim

  - If you have started vim and not specified a file name before hand E.g `vim /var/tmp/aboutme` you can do a `:w /var/tmp/aboutme` to save that file to that location.

>[!NOTE]
>  These Commands are done in command mode or default mode

```vim
`yy` --> to copy a line.
`p` --> to paste said line.


If you want to paste the same line multiple times to make an edit easier. you can do a `yy` to copy or `yank` the line then do a `10p`. This will paste the line you copied or yanked 10 times.

`dw` --> will delete the word you are on top of.
`x` --> will delete the letter it is on top of.
`d$` --> will delete from where the cursor is to the end of the line.

`Visual Line `Mode` --> You can look at the file from a visual perspective and from there you can use some commands to copy, paste, or delete.

`Visual Block Mode` --> Same as above but by block instead of the whole line. Good for wanting to edit the first parts` of` a line.

`vimturor` --> opens an interactive tutorial on how to use vim!
`G` --> Goes to end of the file.
```

## Change the Shell environment

`/etc/profile` --> login script for all shells for all users
`~/.profile` --> login script for all shells (user specific)
`/etc/bashrc` --> login script for the bash shell for all users
`~/.bashrc` --> login sccript for bash (user specific)

```bash
HISTFILESIZE=10000 #(10K Lines for bash History)
HISTTIMEFORMAT="%G %T " #(Time stamps when command was ran.)
alias sc="grep ^[^#] $1" #(strips comments from file.)

mcd () {
    mkdir -pv $1 && cd $1
} # This function will create a dir and then change into it.

export  EDITOR=/usr/bin/vim #(Changes the default editor to vim or whatever you specify as.)
```

# Chapter 6

## Manage Local Users and Groups
`Processes` --> Process ID's (PIDs)
`Users` --> User ID's (UIDs)
`Groups` --> Group ID's (GIDs)
`Files` --> index nodes (inodes)

You can use a `id`. This will tell you the `uid`,`gid` and other information.

## Manage Local User Accounts
when doing a `useradd` the id created is the next available id starting after 1000.

E.g being `useradd jersh` as long as there are no other accounts would be given the id of `1001`.

`usermod -c` --> changes the comment field for said user E.g `usermod -`c "Joshua Ross" jersh` would change the comment for the jersh user to Joshua Ross.

`id` --> wil give you the groups that said user is in?

`usermod -G wheel` --> will add said user to the wheel group as a sup group. This will overwrite the current sup group if you want to add it as well ekeep the other you can do a

`usermod -aG wheel` to add the wheel group to that user along with the other groups.

`userdel -r $USER` --> This will delete the user along with the homedir.

## Manage Local Groups

`getent` --> Get's group information.

## Manage User Passwords
user accoutnt info --> `/etc/passwd`
group account info --> `/etc/group`
password info --> `/etc/shadow`


## Interpert Linux File System Permissions

There are 6 types of Permissions.

first bit is the `file tpye`
second bit is `owning user`
second but is `owning group`
third bit is `other` <br>

`chown` for change user
`chgrrp` for changing group.

E.g for a dir would be
`drwxr-x---` this would give the permissions that only the owning user can `rwx` to dir and thr group can do a `rx` not write.

---

`sticky bit` <-- dir's only the owning user can delete  a file from a dir.

E.g  of setting a sticky bit would be `chmod 1770 /data`. the permssions would then look like `rwxrwx--T`.The `T` meaning the sticky bit has been Set. <br>

`chmod o+t` or `chmod  1 NNN` identified in permissiosn for others.

---

`SetGID` bit <-- files and dir's
-  the owning group of a newly created file is derived from the dir that hte file is created in (for dirs)
-  executables run with permissions of the owning group of the executable (for files)
- `chmod g+s /dir` or `chmod 2 NNN /dir`. `NNN` is the meaning of the rwx permissions.
-  `chmod g+s /file` or `chmod 2 NNN /file`.
- identified in permissions for owning grpup. <br>
  - E.g of this being used like above would be `chmod 2770 /data`<br>
this can also be used as `chmod 3770 /data`.(this will set the sticky bit and the GID)

---

`SetUID` <-- files only
-  executables run with permissions of the owning user of the executable.
- `chmod u+s /file` or `chmod 4NNN`
- identified by permissions for owning user.

You can set a `umask` either at a system level or a user level. It just needs to be set in the `.bashrc` or `/etc/bashrc`.


# Chapter 8

## Monitor and Manage Linux Processes

Any process can create a child process the same goes with a child process it as well can create a child process. Something to be noted all child Processes would be dependent on the parent process.

`pstree` will show you the process tree of the current system. Something to be noted as well `systemd` is the top parent process.

With processes, one is usually running and one is runnable or queued up.

`sleeping state` --> States that are waiting for it to be called E.g a web server will often be sleeping until a connection is made.

`zombie process` --> when a process is killed off and all resources are returned besides the `PID`. The system will then label this as a zombie process until it is killed off.

---
you can use the `ps` command to show the running Processes. E.g you can do a `ps aux | grep bash` to see any instances of bash running.

## ps indicators

`I` = Process is idle
`S` = Process is sleeping
`Z` = zombie process, the task was killed off but the `pid` was not returned.
`R` = Running, the process is running and actively getting CPU cycles `T` =  The process is defined but has been stopped from getting CPU cyles.

## Control Jobs

You can run Processes in the background by doing a `process &` this will start the process but then keep it running in the background so its possible to run other commands or processes will the initial one is still running. <br>

if you need to check what jobs you have running you can issue a `jobs` command to get a list of all the jobs that are running and then if you need to bring it to the foreground you can issue a `fg %1` to bring it to the foreground.

If you need to stop a process you can issue a `^Z` or `CTRL + Z`to stop the process. If you would like to send it to the background all you need to do is a `bg %1` to send it to the background.


## Load Average
To determine the load you can take the number given to you by lets says `uptime` divide it by the number of CPU's to get how much it is either underload or overloaded.<br>

to kill a process, their are many ways to see the options you can do a `kill -l` to see the options.

when killing a process if you do not specify an option the default use is `SIGTERM`. <br>

A way to kill of a process if you don't know what it's pid is to do a `pidof` the process. this will then give you the pid and then from there you can do a `kill` pid` to kill of the process. Reminder that when doing this without options this will only stop the process and not kill it off. unless it can actually kill off the process.

`top` --> The command will show you the load of the CPU ,but also the uptime of the server. A more modern version of this command is called `htop`. <br>
A Reminder for killing of the process is if not specified it will auto-perform a `kill` -15` also known` as `SIGTERM` which is a graceful shutdown.

When in the top command if you hit `k` then type in the `pid` it will kill off that process.

# Chapter 9

## Control Services and daemons

Redhat as of RHEL 7 has switched over to `systemd` from `init`<br>
The command used to control **Systemd** is `systemctl`. <br>
Systemd starts with PID 1. As it is the master process and all other fork or branch off it.<br><br>
A good command to remember is `systemctl` list-units -t service` this will display all units that are currently loaded and identified as a service.<br>
You could also run a `systemctl list-units -t service -a` this will display all services that are currently known to systemd even if they are not loaded.  <br>
When running a `systemctl status` it will tell you information about the said service but also relay the man pages to that specific service. This is good for If we need to learn more `about a `specific` services` mentioned in` the Video do not make changes to files under `/usr/lib` those are owned by the system and are not meant to be touched.

## Control System Services

>[!NOTE] Commands to know!
`pidof` will list all the ID's assoicated with that service. <br>
`systemctl list-dependencies $SERVICE` - will liste the dependencies of said service.<br>

# Chapter 10

## Configure and Secure SSH

> [!NOTE]
> `SSH` Stands for Secure Shell.

Each server has its unique fingerprint when accessing the server the terminal will prompt you with a prompt asking if you trust this server.

> [!NOTE]
> The fingerprint from the server after you accept it will be store in `~/.ssh/known_hosts`.

If you do a `w --from` it will display information like the one show below on who is logged into the server.

```bash
USER     TTY      FROM             LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU WHAT
student  pts/0    172.25.250.9     11:29    1:26   0.01s  0.01s -bash
student  pts/1    172.25.250.9     11:30    2.00s  0.03s  0.01s w --from
```

# Chapter 11

## Validate Network Configuration

> [!NOTE]
> - The iptool is used for both ipv4 and ipv6
> - ping does have a a version for both and so does tracepath.

- `mtr` - a network diagnostic tool.
- `ss` - another utility to investigate sockets.
- `nmap` - Network exploration tool and security/port scanner

## Configure Networking from the Command Line

RedHat Enterprise Linux uses NetworkManager to do it's netowrking. Below are some ways to interact with it.
- `nmtui` - Graphical Interface for NetworkManager.
- `nmcli` - CLI Interface for NetworkManager.
- `web console` - Cockpit web interface.
- `ansible` - you can use playbooks to change NetworkManager configs.

`/etc/resolv.conf` - Has DNS information. This Includes **hostname** and **nameservers**.

- `nmcli c s` shows the info of the connection.


## Configure Hostnames and Name Resolution

- `hostnamectl` - Gives information about the host. Below is an example.

![hostnamectl](/_resources/images/hostnamectl.png)


# Chapter 12

## Install and Update Software Packages

The Red Hat CDN consists of 3 update branches.
- `RHBA` - Bug Fixes Advisory
- `RHEA` - Enhancements Advisory
- `RHSA` - Security Advisory

To get this content you will need to register the server with the subscription you have.

![subscription](/_resources/images/subscription.png)

Above is one of the ways to Register a server to a subscription.

If you would like to see what apps are installed on the machine you can do a `rpm -qa | head -20`
