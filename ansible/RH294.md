# Chapter 1. Introducing Ansible

## What Is Ansible?

Ansible is an open-source automation platform. It is a simple automation language that can accurately describe an IT application infrastructure in Ansible Playbooks. It is also an automation engine that runs Ansible Playbooks.

Ansible can manage powerful automation tasks and can adapt to many workflows and environments. At the same time, new users of Ansible can very quickly use it to become productive.

Ansible is agentless meaning nothing has to be installed on the servers it is interacting with. You only need a Master node which is referred to as the controller node. When setting up the infrastructure for this you will need two main things to at least get the ball rolling.

- A Inventory File
- A Config File.

## Installing Ansible
`Ansible-Core` - This is the barebones install of Ansible.

`Community Ansible` -  Comunity Supported Ansible

# Chapter 2. Implementing an Ansible Playbook

Playbooks depend on an inventory file to read from. Below are some examples of inventory files

```ini
[webservers]
web1.example.com
web2.example.com
192.0.2.42

[db-servers]
db1.example.com
db2.example.com

[east-datacenter]
web1.example.com
db1.example.com

[west-datacenter]
web2.example.com
db2.example.com

[production]
web1.example.com
web2.example.com
db1.example.com
db2.example.com

[development]
192.0.2.42
```

- This is an example of a nested group.

```ini
[usa]
washington1.example.com
washington2.example.com

[canada]
ontario01.example.com
ontario02.example.com

[north-america:children]
canada
usa
```

These are examples of basic inv files you can have many and just need to reference them in the playbooks.

## Writing and Running Playbooks

Something to note that Ansible uses modules built on Python that are used in the palybooks.
